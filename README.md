======================================================================================================================================

2nd Year Computer Science Student and Machine Learning Student Research Assisstant
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My identity is my north star, guiding me in every aspect of my life, from choosing research topics to embarking on creative projects. As a woman of color studying in the States having grown up in a different culture and country previously, I've learnt to weave my roots into every thread of my work. Many of the projects I undertake are deeply personal, not just reflecting my identities, but also echoing my diverse interests that range from community service, disability advocacy to exploring books and cafes. 

Each project I engage in is a mirror, reflecting both my mind's intricacies and my heart's passions. I sincerely hope that they offer you a glimpse into my essence, my character, and my journey. Through these reflections, I invite you to understand who I am - not just as a person but as a passionate learner, a dedicated community member, and an explorer of the world's diverse cultures and experiences.
